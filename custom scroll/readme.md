# Custom scrollbar

An experimental scrollbar I made with restyled HTML input range element. 

It has the same behaviour across Chrome, Mozilla and Edge and supports click and drag scrolling, as well as touch and drag and mouse scrolls. 

As for logic, it adds margin (or top/bottom position) to the element that needs scrolling. 
The margin values are calculated from the invisible part of the element that needs scrolling and the current value of the input range bar.
